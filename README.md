💻 "POSITIVE-NEGATIVE CHECKER" & "GRADING SYSTEM" & "POINT COORDINATES"

🎯 Aim

a) To determine whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
b) To assign a grade based on marks entered by the user.
c) To identify the quadrant or axis location of a point using its coordinates.

📚 Theory

C++ is a structured, high-performance programming language that supports procedural and object-oriented paradigms. This experiment demonstrates decision-making and logical evaluation using control statements and operators. The programs utilize various types of operators, including:

🔹 Relational operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) for comparing values
🔹 Logical operators (&&, ||, !) for combining conditions
🔹 Assignment operator (=) for storing values
🔹 Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) for basic calculations (used in grading logic or coordinate math)
These operators are applied within if-else constructs to evaluate conditions and guide program flow. Input is captured using cin, and output is displayed using cout, both part of the iostream library.

🔢 Part a) "Positive-Negative Checker"

The program accepts an integer and uses relational operators to check its sign. Logical branching via if-else determines whether the number is positive, negative, or zero, and displays the result accordingly.

📝 Part b) "Grading System"

Marks are entered by the user and evaluated using relational and logical operators. Based on predefined ranges, the program assigns grades (e.g., O, A+, A, B+, B) using nested if-else conditions. Arithmetic may be used for calculating percentages or averages if extended.

📍 Part c) "Point Coordinates"

The program takes two inputs (x and y) and uses relational and logical operators to determine the point’s location. It identifies the quadrant (I–IV), origin, or axis by evaluating the signs and values of the coordinates.

🧠 Conclusion

These programs highlight how structured logic in C++ transforms real-world decisions into executable actions. Whether it's evaluating numerical signs, assigning academic grades, or pinpointing coordinates, each task reinforces the power of conditional constructs and operators. Practical logic meets programmable clarity.💡💻
